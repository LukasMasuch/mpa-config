## Summary 

Streamlit recently [released multi-page apps](https://blog.streamlit.io/introducing-multipage-apps/)! This repository shows how to use a [page_config.yaml](https://github.com/blackary/mpa-config/blob/main/page_config.yaml) file to control the ordering, icons, and nesting of the pages in the sidebar of a multi-page Streamlit app.

Features include:

- Controling the order of the pages displayed
- Nesting related apps within a "section"
- Adding a created date on each app, and automatically adding a üÜï icon
- Automatically adding the icon and title at the top of each page
- Displaying some pages in wide-mode

‚ö†Ô∏è This project depends on an API that may change, and is not designed to be used this way,
so this will probably NOT work long-term.
