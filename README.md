# Streamlit Multi-Page Configuration

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://blackary-mpa-config-streamlit-app-0bp2ol.streamlitapp.com/)

An example of how to use a page_config.yaml file to control the ordering, icons, and nesting
of the pages in the sidebar of a Multi-Page Streamlit App.

Features include:

- Controling the order of the pages displayed
- Nesting related apps within a "section"
- Adding a created date on each app, and automatically adding a ðŸ†• icon
- Automatically adding the icon and title at the top of each page

Note that this depends on an API that may change, and is not designed to be used this way,
so this will probably NOT work long-term.
